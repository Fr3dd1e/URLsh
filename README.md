# URLsh

Just a wrapper around a github gist from: https://gist.github.com/cdown/1163649
  
Is great for when you're playing around with `curl`, and don't want to load up cyberchef every time. 
  
Plus, a good way for me to learn how to use bash's `getopts`
  
  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Fr3dd1e/URLsh.git
cd URLsh
sudo ln -sf $(pwd)/urlsh.sh /usr/bin/urlsh
```
